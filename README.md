# EBC-Tutorials
All EBC tutorials in one place

As a first implementation, you can find our introduction to version control with Git at [EBC-Git-101](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/EBC-Tutorials/tree/master/EBC-Git-101)

**This is currently under construction. But the aim is to have directories for different EBC tutorials in markdown format, with additional resources as an optional add-on.**
