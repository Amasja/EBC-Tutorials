# Introduction

This is a Tutorial to use Python at our institute. This is **not** a tutorial to teach you the basics of programming or python. There are a lot better tutorials online (we included some links), we'd refer you to use those.
So what will you find in this tutorial? You'll mainly find three things. At first we'll give a brief introduction into some aspects of programming. We want to make sure that we talk about the same things using the correct wording. If you are already familiar with these concepts: Great, if not, it may avoid some misunderstandings. The second one is an instruction how to get your python installation running. With following these instructions you'll make sure that
* all necessary packages are up to date
* you can access EBC libraries
* you don't use a version somebody may have toyed around with

This will ensure that you can start working with Python without running into some nasty and unnecessary obstacles, keeping you away from getting work done.

In the third part we'll introduce some concepts that may help you to become better at programming, fit into EBCs style of programming (something we are still developing) and give you some ideas for a best practice that we expect to save you some time. We are not without faults, so if you find better or more efficient solutions: Feel free to suggest them. In the best case you contribute to our EBC Libraries via Git (it is a version control system. You can not destroy anything, so have no fear). The concepts are backed up by examples in Jupyter Notebooks. We don't expect everybody to understand all the examples, especially not at the beginning. But if you are planning your code and move forward in your project, we hope that some of these concepts resurface in your brain and you come back here to have a look. Everything in here has, for sure, already been written, probably in a better way. But here we have everything in one place, this is the true advantage of this tutorial.

In a nutshell we will

* make us use all the same wording
* get you started with the environment
* point you to some "learn to code" tutorials
* show you some concepts that may help you improving your coding efficiency (We made already a lot of mistakes for you, you do not have to re-do those)

In the end, we want you to be able to use EBC's own Python libraries and even advance them. You should also recognize the advantages of object orientation and be able to use it.
