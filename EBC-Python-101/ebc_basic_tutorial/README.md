##  Let's get startet: How to write a function in Python

Aim: Write a mathematical function, which (exclusively) squares integer numbers.
Thus, we are going to generate an Python file named example_1.py and write a function

def square_int_number(number):
    squared_nb = number ** 2  # Square input number
    return squared_nb
'''
